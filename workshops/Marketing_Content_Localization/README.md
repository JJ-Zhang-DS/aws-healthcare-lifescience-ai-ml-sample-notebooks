## 4. Service Details

### 4.1. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

 [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

### 4.2. Amazon Bedrock

 [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that's best suited for your use case. With the Bedrock serverless experience, you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into your applications using the AWS tools and capabilities you are familiar with (including integrations with Amazon SageMaker ML features such as Experiments to test different models and Pipelines to manage your FMs at scale) without having to manage any infrastructure.

### 4.3. Amazon Textract

 [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration (which often must be updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and act on the information extracted, whether youâ€™re automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days. Additionally, you can add human reviews with Amazon Augmented AI to provide oversight of your models and check sensitive data.

### 4.4. Amazon Translate

[Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) is a neural machine translation service that delivers fast, high-quality, affordable, and customizable language translation.
