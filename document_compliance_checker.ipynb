    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmaceutical Manufacturing faces a complex regulatory and quality hurdle since there is a pressing need to ensure that manufacturing processes adhere to regulatory frameworks. Frequently, manual analysis of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that govern Manufacturing Protocols is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic's Claude models can be used to detect compliance issues in documents and generate suggestions to remediate any problems. Compliance with regulations, policies, and best practices is crucial for many organizations, but manually reviewing documents is tedious and error-prone. AI assistants quickly built using Amazon Bedrock and using LLM's like the Claude models can automate parts of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through an example using a sample text document. Claude will analyze the document and highlight any compliance issues it detects. We will then request Claude to remediate the document to correct any problems and bring it into compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should have a good understanding of how to configure and use Amazon Bedrock, use a given model, in this case Claude, and integrate it into applications that require document compliance checking and assistance. The methods shown can be adapted to many different domains including legal contracts, financial reports, medical records, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about [Bedrock here](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).  Look here for details about the [Anthropic Claude Models and how to use them with Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "Protocol documents and the rules to verify them (standard operating procedures) will be combined using a natural language prompt which instructs the LLM how to compare them and what to report back to the requestor. We'll experiment with two scenarios:\n",
    "1. Compare the protocol docuemnt against the standard operating procedure and __report__ any deviations.\n",
    "1. Compare the protocol document against the standard operating procedure and __correct__ any deviations.\n",

    "Below you can specify the various parameters that are used by the LLM. The available LLM parameters vary slightly by model provider. Here are common model parameters you can use with the Claude models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Temperature (temperature in the prompt body)** – Large language models use probability to construct the words in a sequence. For any \n",
    "given next word, there is a probability distribution of options for the next word in the sequence. When \n",
    "you set the temperature closer to zero, the model tends to select the higher-probability words. When \n",
    "you set the temperature further away from zero, the model may select a lower-probability word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In technical terms, the temperature modulates the probability density function for the next tokens, \n",
    "implementing the temperature sampling technique. This parameter can deepen or flatten the density \n",
    "function curve. A lower value results in a steeper curve with more deterministic responses, and a higher \n",
    "value results in a flatter curve with more random responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top K (top_k in the prompt body)** – Temperature defines the probability distribution of potential words, and Top K defines the cut \n",
    "off where the model no longer selects the words. For example, if K=50, the model selects from 50 of the \n",
    "most probable words that could be next in a given sequence. This reduces the probability that an unusual \n",
    "word gets selected next in a sequence.\n",
    "In technical terms, Top K is the number of the highest-probability vocabulary tokens to keep for Top-\n",
    "K-filtering - This limits the distribution of probable tokens, so the model chooses one of the highest-\n",
    "probability tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top P (top_p in the prompt body)** – Top P defines a cut off based on the sum of probabilities of the potential choices. If you set Top \n",
    "P below 1.0, the model considers the most probable options and ignores less probable ones. Top P is \n",
    "similar to Top K, but instead of capping the number of choices, it caps choices based on the sum of their \n",
    "probabilities.\n",
    "For the example prompt \"I hear the hoof beats of ,\" you may want the model to provide \"horses,\" \n",
    "\"zebras\" or \"unicorns\" as the next word. If you set the temperature to its maximum, without capping \n",
    "Top K or Top P, you increase the probability of getting unusual results such as \"unicorns.\" If you set the \n",
    "temperature to 0, you increase the probability of \"horses.\" If you set a high temperature and set Top K or \n",
    "Top P to the maximum, you increase the probability of \"horses\" or \"zebras,\" and decrease the probability \n",
    "of \"unicorns.\"\n",
    "\n",

We loaded a manufacturing protocol document and standard operating procedure (SOP) into variables to construct a prompt which asked the Claude LLM to compare the documents and report any deviations from the SOP. Claude successfully identified issues with the manufacturing protocol not following the SOP. We then updated the prompt to ask Claude to not just flag deviations but also correct them. Claude was able to take the non-compliant protocol and rewrite it to align with the SOP. his demonstrates how Amazon Bedrock and Claude can be used to check documents for compliance to standards and even automatically remediate problems.
